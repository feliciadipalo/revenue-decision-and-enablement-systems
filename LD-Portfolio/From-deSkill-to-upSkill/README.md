# From deSkill to upSkill

**Learning that means business.**

Part of my *Learning & Development Portfolio*, this concept explores how organisations can move from traditional training to continuous enablement — transforming learning from a time cost into a performance driver.

### The idea

**deSkill** describes the silent erosion that happens when learning becomes disconnected from work.  
Hours in training rooms, endless slide decks, and completion rates celebrated while capability quietly declines.  

deSkill isn’t about forgetting; it’s about friction — when knowledge can’t move fast enough to meet reality.

To reverse it, organisations must move from **training to enablement**.  
Not more courses, but better flow:  
- Micro-learning loops that replace recall with practice  
- Real-time feedback that makes learning social and adaptive  
- Performance support that delivers the right resource at the right moment  

That is **upSkill** — when capability meets the moment and learning finally means business.
