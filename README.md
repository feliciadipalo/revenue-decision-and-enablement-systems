# Revenue Enablement Systems

This repository contains practical frameworks that treat enablement as a controlled decision system tied directly to revenue quality, forecast confidence, and execution readiness.

The work shown here focuses on governing pre-sales, onboarding, and capability development as measurable, repeatable operating systems rather than training or content delivery.

## 1. Integrated Sales Enablement Framework

A CRM-linked enablement model designed to connect learning activity, deal execution, and revenue outcomes.

This framework establishes structured feedback loops between:
- qualification and discovery
- coaching and performance signals
- CRM data and forecasting confidence

The objective is to reduce revenue risk, improve conversion quality, and make enablement outcomes observable at system level.

## 2. Sales Onboarding System (30–60–90)

A de-branded onboarding architecture designed to accelerate time-to-readiness and reduce early-stage performance variance.

The system structures onboarding as:
- a gated progression from context to execution
- a mix of practice, simulation, and live application
- a data loop connecting readiness signals to pipeline and activity metrics

The focus is operational readiness, not knowledge accumulation.

## 3. From deSkill to upSkill

A conceptual framework addressing why traditional upskilling initiatives fail under real operating pressure.

This model reframes capability as:
- moment-based
- embedded in workflow
- reinforced through decision context rather than standalone training

The framework is intended to support long-term capability integrity in fast-changing commercial environments.

## Scope

These materials are representative samples of system-level enablement work across commercial, technology, and professional services contexts.

They are intentionally de-branded and focused on structure, decision logic, and measurable outcomes.
